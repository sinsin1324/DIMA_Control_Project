				unlimited.

		Example (speed is 32):
		Let's say the distance from your current position to the target 
		is 1008us and you want to take 1.25 seconds (1250ms) to get there. 
		The required speed is (1008us/1250ms) = 0.8064us/ms.
		Converting to units of (0.25us/10ms), 
		0.8064us/ms / (0.25us/10ms) = 32.256.
		So we'll use 32 for the speed.

		Example (speed is 140, from the Maestro manual):
		Let's say we set the speed to 140. That is a speed of 
		3.5us/ms (140 * 0.25us/10ms = 3.5us/ms). If your target is such that

	def set_acceleration(self, channel, accel):
		"""Sets the acceleration of a Maestro channel. Note that once you set

		of that servo motor until you change it to something else.

		Args:
			channel: The channel for the servo motor (0, 1, ...).
			accel: The rate at which you want the motor to accelerate in
				the range of 0 to 255. 0 means there's no acceleration limit.
				The value is in units of (0.25 us)/(10 ms)/(80 ms).

		Example (acceleration is ):
		Let's say our motor is currently not moving and we're setting our 
		speed to 32, meaning 0.8064us/ms (see the example for set_speed()).
		Let's say we want to get up to that speed in 0.5 seconds. 
		Think of 0.8064us/ms as you would 0.8064m/ms (m for meters) if you 
		find the 'us' confusing.
		Step 1. Find the acceleration in units of us/ms/ms:
		accel = (Vfinal - Vinitial) / time, V means velocity or speed
		Vfinal = 0.8064us/ms
		Vinitial = 0us/ms (the motor was not moving to begin with)
		time = 0.5 seconds = 500ms
		Therefore:
		accel = (0.8064us/ms - 0us/ms) / 500ms = 0.0016128us/ms/ms
		Step 2. Convert to units of (0.25 us)/(10 ms)/(80 ms):
		0.0016128us/ms/ms / [(0.25 us)/(10 ms)/(80 ms)] = 
		0.0016128us/ms/ms / 0.0003125us/ms/ms = 5.16096
		So we'll set the acceleration to 5.

		Example (acceleration is 4, from the Maestro manual):
		A value of 4 means that you want the speed of the servo to change
		by a maximum of 1250us/s every second.
		4 x 0.25us / 10ms / 80ms = 0.00125us/ms/ms,
		which is 1250us/s/s.
